Demo of Selenium tests with .NET Core

- [x] Write test with page objects for Firefox compatibility
- [x] Add 2nd test (should be nice and DRY)
- [x] Add compatibility for Chrome - note, required `sudo apt-get install chromium-chromedriver` for Ubuntu
- [ ] Add build & deploy package (platform agnostic)
- [ ] Run Firefox and Chrome tests in parallel (via deploy instance)
